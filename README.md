# Meal-Planner


Personalized Meal Planner
This Python program is a Personalized Meal Planner that provides customized meal plans based on users' dietary restrictions, preferences, and body goals. By gathering information from the user, such as dietary restrictions, food preferences, and body goals, the program generates personalized meal recommendations and calculates daily calorie intake to help users achieve their desired health and wellness objectives.

Features
User Preferences: The program prompts users to input their dietary restrictions, such as vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, meat-based, or pescatarian, to accommodate their specific dietary needs.
Food Preferences: Users can specify their food preferences, such as Mediterranean, Asian, or comfort food, to tailor the meal recommendations accordingly.
Body Goals: Users are asked to provide their body goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance, to calculate an appropriate calorie intake.
Calorie Intake Calculation: The program estimates the daily calorie intake based on the user's weight, height, and body goals, using a customizable formula.
Personalized Meal Plans: The program generates customized meal plans based on the user's preferences and calorie intake, providing a list of recommended meals for each day.
